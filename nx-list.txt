Standardized Libraries: By using a monorepo approach, you can ensure that all applications within the repository are using the same versions of libraries like Angular and RxJS. This helps in maintaining consistency and reduces the chances of compatibility issues that might arise when different projects use different library versions.

Code Sharing: Breaking down your code into reusable libraries allows for easy sharing of tested and proven code components like services, state management, computed values, and business logic. This not only promotes code reusability but also accelerates the development process and reduces duplicated efforts.

Enforced Code Standards: Nx can enforce code standards by performing checks during the build process. This ensures that the code quality and style guidelines are followed consistently across all applications and libraries, which leads to a more maintainable and readable codebase.

One Pipeline for Multiple Applications: Managing multiple applications within a single monorepo allows you to streamline your development workflow. You can maintain a single CI/CD pipeline that covers all applications, reducing the overhead of managing separate pipelines for each project. This also helps in preventing breaking changes that could impact the entire codebase.

Dependency Graph and Management: Nx provides tools to visualize the dependency graph between different projects, making it easier to understand how different components are interconnected. This visibility helps in making informed decisions about code changes and minimizes unintended side effects.

Computational Cache for Building Artifacts: Nx provides caching mechanisms that can significantly speed up the build process. Cached artifacts can be reused during local builds and within the PR/main processes, reducing build times and improving developer productivity.

Better Developer Experience: Nx workspace tools offer features like code generation, code linting, testing, and more, all integrated within the monorepo setup. This comprehensive tooling enhances the overall developer experience and makes it easier to manage and develop different parts of the project.

In summary, adopting an Nx monorepo approach for your CCM project brings a range of benefits, including standardization, code sharing, code quality enforcement, streamlined pipelines, dependency management, build optimization, and an improved developer experience. However, it's essential to carefully plan and structure your monorepo to ensure that it remains manageable as your project grows.
