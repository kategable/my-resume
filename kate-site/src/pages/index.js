          <h2>A Little More <strong>About</strong> Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, I'm Kateâ€”<strong>a full-stack developer, tech consultant, speaker, and mentor</strong> with over two decades of experience crafting exceptional web applications. My expertise lies in <strong>front-end development</strong>, particularly <strong>Angular</strong>, where I've spent years perfecting the art of creating seamless user experiences.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I'm also the <strong>founder of CSA Technologies Inc.</strong>, where I've helped businesses build <strong>powerful, functional, and scalable web applications</strong>. Beyond the code, I'm deeply passionate about <strong>mentorship and education</strong>, helping aspiring developers navigate their careers with confidence.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But my story isn't just about tech. I'm also a <strong>mother of five</strong> and a <strong>dedicated tennis mom</strong>, cheering on my kids from the sidelines as they compete and grow in the sport. Balancing the fast-paced world of software development with family life has been an incredible journey, and I firmly believe women don't have to choose between career success and personal fulfillmentâ€”we can have both, and I love helping others find that balance.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, consulting, or mentoring, you'll find me <strong>at the tennis courts supporting my kids, exploring new places, and embracing new challenges</strong>. I thrive on <strong>growth, resilience, and empowering others to achieve their dreamsâ€”because if I can do it, so can you.</strong> ðŸš€
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Let's build something amazing together! ðŸ’¡ðŸŽ¾ðŸ’»
